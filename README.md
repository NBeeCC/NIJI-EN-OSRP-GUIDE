## Optifine Installation (Easy)

For those who have little to no experience in modding, and just want to get the pack working properly with less effort.

- First you will want to download both Optifine and the Resource Pack. 

Select the [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads) version for the Minecraft version you want and select the [NIJISANJI EN MOBS & ITEMS](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/project-nijisanji-en-osrp/version/sD3QuNkx) pack for the Minecraft version you want.
