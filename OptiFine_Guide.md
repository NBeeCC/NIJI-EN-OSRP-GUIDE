# Optifine Installation (Easy)

For those who have little to no experience in modding, and just want to get the pack working properly with less effort. Alternatively you can also watch the [YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/dTARzDoH3G4).

- First you will want to download both Optifine and the Resource Pack. 

Select the [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads) version for the Minecraft version you want and select the [NIJISANJI EN MOBS & ITEMS](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/project-nijisanji-en-osrp/version/sD3QuNkx) pack for the Minecraft version you want. Place them in a folder you know how to access easily.

- Next open up your Minecraft Launcher, there the "OptiFine" profile should already be selected, if it is not, change the profile so it has the right version you chose.

- Click on "PLAY". It may give you a warning about a modified Java Edition installation, click on "I understand the risks, don't warn me again" and click Play. It will take a little while to install. The pack will not yet be installed, but Optifine should be installed.
- Once the game launches, if you properly launched Optifine you should see Minecraft ____ (Modded) on the bottom left corner.

- If you saw (Modded) on the bottom left you're good to continue, if not then quit Minecraft and open the Minecraft Launcher again, make sure you've selected the right profile named "OptiFine".
- Next inside Minecraft click Options and then Resource Packs this should open the Resource Packs screen.

- In this screen, click "Open Pack Folder" this should open a folder on your computer which should be empty (unless you're using other Resource Packs).
